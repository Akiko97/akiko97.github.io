The tool incorporates a CPU emulator written in Rust and supports cross-platform compatibility, including WebAssembly. The contributions of the thesis include the proposal of a universal visualization method, the development of the PixelAssemblySIMD tool, and user evaluations that demonstrate its effectiveness in teaching, debugging, and security analysis. Compared to other tools, PixelAssemblySIMD offers advantages in data accuracy and visualization intuitiveness.",

          "description": "The thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a transparent trusted cryptographic module (TCM) support mechanism in cloud environments. This mechanism enables the integration of virtual trusted platform modules (vTCM) into cloud virtual machines without requiring changes to the cloud infrastructure. It monitors virtual machine startup commands, intercepts them to add trusted root support, and binds each virtual machine to a vTCM. The system allows up to 255 virtual machines to receive TCM support, offering functionalities like key creation, encryption/decryption, signing, and integrity reporting. It also ensures that the TCM setup is transparent to users and operates with minimal performance overhead. The proposed solution aims to enhance cloud security by ensuring the trustworthiness of virtual machines in a scalable and efficient manner.",
